## Functionality

### Brand Selector
The brand selector dropdown is the core interactive element of the header.

- **Clicking the brand name** (e.g., "e.l.f. Skin") and the chevron icon will toggle the visibility of the dropdown menu.
- The component manages its own state for the selected brand and the dropdown's visibility.
- Clicking outside the component will close the dropdown menu.

Below is an example of the header with the dropdown menu in its **open state**:

<Story of={HeaderStories.DropdownOpen} />
